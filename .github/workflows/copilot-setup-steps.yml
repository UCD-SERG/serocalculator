# GitHub Copilot Setup Steps for serocalculator
#
# This workflow configures the GitHub Copilot coding agent's environment
# by preinstalling R and all required dependencies.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/
#      coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
# For detailed setup instructions, see .github/copilot-instructions.md
#
# This workflow aligns with the setup requirements documented in
# .github/copilot-instructions.md:
# - R version >= 4.1.0 (as specified in DESCRIPTION)
# - All package dependencies (Imports, Suggests, and development needs)

name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow
# for easy validation, and allow manual testing through the
# repository's "Actions" tab
