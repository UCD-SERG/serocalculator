serocalculator package
=====================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Antibody levels measured in a (cross–sectional) population sample can be
translated into an estimate of the frequency with which seroconversions
(infections) occur in the sampled population. Formulated simply: the
presence of many high titres indicates that many subjects likely
experienced infection recently, while low titres indicate a low
frequency of infections in the sampled population.

The serocalculator script was designed to use the longitudinal
response characteristics by means of a set of parameters characterizing
the longitudinal response of the selected serum antibodies.
