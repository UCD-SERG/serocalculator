# Calculate log-likelihood

Calculates the log-likelihood of a set of cross-sectional antibody
response data, for a given incidence rate (`lambda`) value.

**\[deprecated\]**

`llik()` was renamed to
[`log_likelihood()`](https:/ucd-serg.github.io/serocalculator/preview/pr465/reference/log_likelihood.md)
to create a more consistent API.

## Usage

``` r
llik(...)
```
