In many survey designs, observations are clustered (e.g., multiple individuals from the same household, school, or geographic area). Observations within the same cluster are often more similar to each other than to observations from different clusters, violating the independence assumption of standard maximum likelihood estimation.

### Why clustering matters

When observations are clustered:

* Individuals within the same cluster share common exposures or characteristics
* Standard errors that ignore clustering will be **too small** (anti-conservative)
* Confidence intervals will be **too narrow**
* p-values will be **too optimistic**

### Cluster-robust variance estimation

To account for within-cluster correlation, `serocalculator` implements the **sandwich estimator** (also known as the Huber-White robust variance estimator):

$$V_{\text{robust}} = H^{-1} B H^{-1}$$

where:

* $V_{\text{robust}}$ is the cluster-robust variance-covariance matrix for the parameter estimates
* $H$ is the Hessian matrix (matrix of second partial derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameters, evaluated at the MLE $\hat{\lambda}$)
* $B$ is the "meat" of the sandwich, calculated from cluster-level score contributions:

$$B = \sum_{c=1}^C U_c U_c^T$$

where:

* $C$ is the total number of clusters in the sample
* $U_c = \sum_{i \in c} \nabla_\lambda \log p(Y_i | \lambda)$ is the score contribution (gradient of log-likelihood with respect to $\lambda$) from all observations in cluster $c$
* $\nabla_\lambda$ denotes the gradient operator (vector of partial derivatives with respect to the parameter $\lambda$)

### Implementation in serocalculator

Users can specify clustering using the `cluster_var` parameter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Single-level clustering (e.g., by household)
est <- est_seroincidence(
  pop_data = data,
  cluster_var = "household_id",
  ...
)

# Multi-level clustering (e.g., schools within districts)
est <- est_seroincidence(
  pop_data = data,
  cluster_var = c("district_id", "school_id"),
  ...
)
```

When cluster-robust standard errors are used, the `summary()` output indicates this with `se_type = "cluster-robust"`.

### Effect on results

* **Point estimates** (incidence rates) remain unchanged
* **Standard errors** typically increase by 5-15% to reflect within-cluster correlation
* **Confidence intervals** appropriately widen to account for reduced effective sample size
