Incidence rates are important epidemiological estimands.
The incidence rate of a disease in a population is the rate of new infections per person over time.
<!-- It is typically equivalent to the marginal hazard rate across all individuals in that population. -->
<!-- From a susceptible individualâ€™s perspective, the incidence rate is the hazard rate of disease onset. -->
Incidence rates can be estimated from longitudinal cohort studies,
but cohort studies are costly to conduct, 
slow to produce results, 
and vulnerable to selection and censoring biases.
Incidence rates can also be estimated from clinical case rates,
but clinical case rates undercount asymptomatic cases
and cases in individuals lacking access to clinical care.
Alternatively, incidence rates can be estimated from biomarker data
collected through a single cross-sectional survey, 
combined with a longitudinal model of 
how those biomarkers respond to infection over time.
Compared with cohort studies and clinical case rates,
cross-sectional incidence estimation can 
provide more accurate, timely, and cost-efficient estimates.

This talk will review statistical frameworks for 
modeling longitudinal biomarker responses to infection
and estimating incidence from cross-sectional biomarker surveys,
and it will discuss ongoing work at UC Davis to implement and extend these methods.
