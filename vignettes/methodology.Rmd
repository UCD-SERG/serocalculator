# Introduction

The revised seroincidence calculator package provides three refinements to the method for 
calculating seroincidence published earlier [@teunis_etal12_biomarker] and implemented in R package
**seroincidence**, versions 1.x: (1) inclusion of infection episode with rising antibody levels, (2) 
non--exponential decay of serum antibodies after infection, and (3) age--dependent correction for 
subjects who have never seroconverted. It is important to note that, although the implemented 
methods use a specific parametric model, as proposed in [@degraaf_etal14wh] and augmented in 
[@teunis_etal16withinhost], the methods used to calculate the likelihood function allow 
seroresponses of arbitrary shape.

# 1. A simple model for the seroresponse

The current version of the serocalculator package uses the model of [@teunis_etal16withinhost] for 
the shape of the seroresponse:
$$
\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}
\text{Infection/colonization episode} & \text{Waning immunity episode}\\
b^{\prime}(t) = \mu_{0}b(t) - cy(t) & b(t) = 0 \\
y^{\prime}(t) = \mu y(t) & y^{\prime}(t) = -\nu y(t)^r \\
\end{array}
$$

With baseline antibody concentration $y(0) = y_{0}$ and initial pathogen concentration 
$b(0) = b_{0}$. The serum antibody response $y(t)$ can be written as
$$
y(t) = y_{+}(t) + y_{-}(t)
$$
where
\begin{align*}
y_{+}(t) & = y_{0}\text{e}^{\mu t}[0\le t <t_{1}]\\
y_{-}(t) & = y_{1}\left(1+(r-1)y_{1}^{r-1}\nu(t-t_{1})\right)^{-\frac{1}{r-1}}[t_{1}\le t < \infty]
\end{align*}
Since the peak level is $y_{1} = y_{0}\text{e}^{\mu t_{1}}$ the (unobservable) growth rate $\mu$ can 
be written as 
$$\mu = \frac{1}{t_{1}}\log\left(\frac{y_{1}}{y_{0}}\right)$$

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig/response.pdf}
\caption{\label{response_graph}The antibody level at $t=0$ is $y_{0}$; the rising branch ends at 
$t = t_{1}$ where the peak antibody level $y_{1}$ is reached. Any antibody level 
$y_{0} \le y(t) < y_{1}$ occurs twice.}
\end{figure}

Antibody decay is different from exponential (log--linear) decay. When the shape parameter $r > 1$, 
log concentrations decrease rapidly after infection has terminated, but decay then slows down and 
low antibody concentrations are maintained for a long period. When $r$ approaches 1, exponential 
decay is restored.

# 2. Backward recurrence time

Considering the (fundamental) uniform distribution $u_{f}$ of sampling within a given interval, the 
interval length distribution $p(\Delta t)$ and the distribution of (cross--sectionally) sampled 
interval length [@teunis_etal12_biomarker]
$$
q(\Delta t) = \frac{p(\Delta t)\cdot\Delta t}{\overline{\Delta t_{p}}}
$$
the joint distribution of backward recurrence time and cross--sectional interval length is the 
product $u_{f}\cdot q$ because these probabilities are independent.

The distribution of backward recurrence time is the marginal distribution
\begin{align*}
u(\tau) & = \int_{\Delta t=0}^{\infty} u_{f}(\tau;\Delta t)\cdot q(\Delta t)\text{d}\Delta t\\
        & = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{[0\le\tau\le\Delta t]}{\Delta t}\cdot \frac{p(\Delta t)\cdot
            \Delta t}{\overline{\Delta t_{p}}}\text{d}\Delta t\\
        & = \frac{1}{\overline{\Delta t_{p}}}\int_{\tau}^{\infty}p(\Delta t)\text{d}\Delta t
\end{align*}

# 3. Incidence of seroconversions

To calculate the incidence of seroconversions, as in [@teunis_etal12_biomarker], the distribution 
$p(\Delta t)$ of intervals $\Delta t$ between seroconversions, is important. Assuming any subject is 
sampled completely at random during their intervals between seroconversions, and accounting for 
interval length bias [@satten_etal04; @zelen04], the distribution of backward recurrence times 
$\tau$ can be written as [@teunis_etal12_biomarker]
$$
u(\tau) = \frac{1}{\overline{\Delta t}} \int_{\tau=0}^{\infty}p(\Delta t)\text{d}\Delta t 
        = \frac{1-P(\Delta t)}{\overline{\Delta t}}
$$
where $\overline{\Delta t}$ is the $p$--distribution expected value of $\Delta t$.

This density is employed to estimate seroconversion rates. The antibody concentration $y$ is the 
observable quantity, and we need to express the probability (density) of observed $y$ in terms of 
the density of backward recurrence time.

First, the backward recurrence time can $\tau$ be expressed as a function of the serum antibody 
concentration $y$
$$
\tau(y) = \tau_{+}(y) + \tau_{-}(y)
$$
where
\begin{align*}
\tau_{+}(y) & = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{\mu}} \log\left(\displaystyle{\frac{y_{+}}{y_{0}}}\right) [0\le \tau<t_{1}]\\
\tau_{-}(y) & = \left(t_{1} + \displaystyle{\frac{y_{-}^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}}\right)[t_{1}\le \tau < \infty]
\end{align*}
with corresponding derivatives
$$
\frac{\text{d}\tau_{+}}{\text{d}y} = \frac{1}{\mu y_{+}} \quad \text{ and } \quad
\frac{\text{d}\tau_{-}}{\text{d}y} = - \frac{1}{\nu y_{-}^{r}}
$$

Now, consider the probability that an antibody level $y^{\prime}$, corresponding to a time since 
infection $\tau^{\prime}$, is less than or equal to $y$ (see Figure \ref{response_graph}) 
\begin{align*}
P(y^{\prime} \le y) & = P\left(y_{0} \le y_{+}(\tau^{\prime})\le y_{+}(\tau) \vee y_{-}(\tau^{\prime}) 
                        \le y_{-}(\tau) \le t_{1}\right) + [y_{1} < y]\\
                    & = P\left(0 \le \tau^{\prime}\le \frac{1}{\mu} 
                        \log\left(\frac{y_{+}}{y_{0}}\right)\right)\\
                    &   \qquad {} + P\left(t_{1}+\frac{y_{-}^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)} \le 
                        \tau^{\prime} < \infty\right) + [y_{1} < y]
\end{align*}

The probability density for $y$ then is 
\begin{align*}
\rho(y) & = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}y} P(y^{\prime}\le y)\\
        & = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\tau_{+}}\frac{\text{d}\tau_{+}}{\text{d}y_{+}} 
            P\left(0\le\tau^{\prime}\le\tau_{+}(y)\right) +
            \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\tau_{-}}\frac{\text{d}\tau_{-}}{\text{d}y_{-}} 
            P\left(t_{1}+\tau_{-}(y)\le\tau^{\prime}<\infty\right)\\
        & = \rho_{+}(y_{+}) + \rho_{-}(y_{-})
\end{align*}

So that
\begin{equation}\label{rho_y}
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{+}(y_{+}) & = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{\mu y_{+}}} u\left(\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\mu}}\log\left(\displaystyle{\frac{y_{+}}{y_{0}}}\right)\right)\\
\rho_{-}(y_{-}) & = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{\nu y_{-}^{r}}} u\left(t_{1} + \displaystyle{\frac{y_{-}^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
when $[y_{0} \le y < y_{1}]$ there are two contributions to the density, one from the rising and one 
from the decaying branch of the antibody response.

If, as assumed before [@teunis_etal12_biomarker], intervals between incident infections are 
generated by a process with Gamma probability density, $\overline{\Delta t} = (m+1)/\lambda$. The 
cumulative distribution function for $\tau$ is
\begin{equation}\label{pm_cumul}
P_{m}(\tau) = 1-\frac{\Gamma(m+1, \lambda\tau)}{m!}
\end{equation}
and the density of backward recurrence times is
\begin{equation}\label{bwrectime_pdf}
u_{m}(\tau) = \frac{1-P_{m}(\tau)}{\overline{\Delta t}} =
  \frac{\lambda\Gamma(m+1,\lambda\tau)}{(m+1)!} =
  \frac{\lambda\text{e}^{-\lambda\tau}}{m+1}
  \sum_{j=0}^{m}\frac{(\lambda\tau)^{j}}{j!}
\end{equation}

Combining equations \eqref{rho_y} and \eqref{bwrectime_pdf} the marginal density of $y$ can be found
\begin{equation}
\label{margdist_y_increase}
\rho_{+}(y_{+}) = [y_{0} \le y_{+} < y_{1}] \frac{\lambda y_{0}}{\mu(m+1)}
                  \left(\frac{y_{+}}{y_{0}}\right)^{-(1+\lambda/\mu)}
                  \sum_{j=0}^{m} \frac{\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\log(y_{+}/y_{0})\right)^{j}}{j!}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}\label{margdist_y_decay}
\rho_{-}(y_{-}) & = [0< y_{-} \le y_{1}] \frac{\lambda}{\nu y_{-}^{r}(m+1)} 
                    \text{e}^{-\lambda\left(t_{1}+\frac{y_{-}^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}\right)} \nonumber\\
                &   \qquad {} \times\sum_{j=0}^{m}\frac{\lambda^{j}}{j!}\left(t_{1}+
                    \frac{y_{-}^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}\right)^{j}
\end{align}
where $\rho_{+}$ and $\rho_{-}$ refer to the contributions of the rising and decaying part of the 
seroresponse to the density of $y$.

The within--host parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (y_{0}, y_{1}, t_{1}, \nu, r)$ vary among 
responses of individual subjects. Heterogeneity in these parameters may be described by their joint 
distribution, which can be used to calculate the marginal distribution $\rho(y)$ 
[@teunis_etal12_biomarker]. Since a Monte Carlo sample of the posterior joint distribution is 
available from the longitudinal model [@teunis_etal16withinhost] the marginal distribution of 
$\rho(y)$ may be approximated by the sum
\begin{equation}\label{rho_numsum}
\rho(y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{+}(y\vert \lambda, m, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{n}) + 
          \rho_{-}(y\vert \lambda, m, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{n})
\end{equation}
for a Monte Carlo sample 
$(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{2}, \dots, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{N})$. A 
cross--sectional sample of antibody concentrations $(Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \dots, Y_{K})$ can now be used to 
calculate a likelihood
$$
\ell(\lambda,m) = \prod_{k=1}^{K}\rho(Y_{k}\vert \lambda, m)
$$
that can be used to estimate $(\lambda, m)$.

# 4. True seronegative subjects

At the time that a cross--sectional serum sample is collected, the subject whose blood is drawn may 
have never been infected in their lifetime. The antibody concentration $y$ in that sample then 
represents a true seronegative. For such a sample, the backward recurrence time does not exist. For 
a given longitudinal response, the backward recurrence time $\tau$ corresponding with measured 
antibody concentration $Y$ can be calculated. If that backward recurrence time is longer than the 
age of the person (at time of sampling), their antibody concentration $Y$ cannot have resulted from 
prior seroconversion.

If, in the summation in equation \eqref{rho_numsum}, terms not satisfying the condition 
$\tau(y) < a$ are discarded, the resulting partial sum
$$
\rho^{\ast}(y,a) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}[\tau(y,\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n}) < a]
                   (\rho_{+}(y\vert\lambda,m,\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n}) +
                   (\rho_{-}(y\vert\lambda,m,\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n})
$$
counts only those seroconversions that can have occurred during the lifespan of the person whose 
serum was sampled.

Serum from a true seronegative subject is expected to have a low antibody concentration, 
representative of a ``true'' negative sample [@degreeff_etal12]. The antibody concentrations $y$ in 
sera from such truly negative subjects are not expected to decay over time: the baseline 
distribution $\rho_{0}(y)$ may be assumed fixed and independent of $m$ and $\lambda$. Note that also 
when $y$ corresponds to a backward recurrence time within the lifespan of a person, that same 
antibody concentration $y$ could still result from the baseline distribution $\rho_{0}(y)$.

Given the interval distribution for incident infections, the probability that a sampled subject has 
never seroconverted depends on their age. For the gamma process assumed above, the survival function
$P_{m}(a\vert m, \lambda)$ gives the probability of a subject having not seroconverted before age 
$a$ (equation \eqref{pm_cumul}).

Thus, for a serum sample with antibody concentration $y$ from a subject of age $a$ the probability 
density is
$$
\psi (\lambda, m\vert y, a, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{0}) =
\rho^{\ast}(y, a) + P_{m}(a\vert m, \lambda)\rho_{0}(y\vert \boldsymbol{\theta}_{0})
$$

When the seroconversion rate is low, or a subject is young, or both, the probability of a true 
negative may be considerable.

# 5. Censored observations

In case observations are censored at $y_{c}$ such that an observed $Y = \max(Y,y_{c})$, then for 
$y_{c} < Y$ the density $\rho(y)$ as in equations \eqref{margdist_y_increase} and 
\eqref{margdist_y_decay} holds, but the likelihood of any $Y \le y_{c}$ can be calculated 
$$
\ell(\lambda, m \vert y \le y_{c}) = \int_{z=0}^{y_{c}} \rho(z, \lambda, m) \text{d}z = R(y_{c}\vert\lambda,m)
$$
We need the cumulative distribution $R(y)$ for the backward recurrence time, from equation 
\eqref{bwrectime_pdf}.
$$
U_{m}(\tau) = \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m} P_{j}(\tau\vert\lambda)
$$
while the cumulative distribution of antibody levels $y$ is
\begin{align*}
P(y^{\prime} \le y) & = U\left(\frac{1}{\mu}\log\left(\frac{y}{y_{0}} \right)\right) [y_{0}\le y < y_{1}] +\\
                    &   \qquad {} \left(1-U\left(t_{1}+\frac{y^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}
                        {\nu(r-1)}\right)\right) [y\le y_{1}] + [y_{1} < y]
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align*}
R(y) & = \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m}P_{j} \left(\frac{1}{\mu}\log
         \left(\frac{y}{y_{0}}\right)\vert\lambda\right) [y_{0} \le y < y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + \left(1 - \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m}P_{j}\left(t_{1}+
         \frac{y^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}\vert\lambda\right)\right)[y \le y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + [y_{1} < y]
\end{align*}

Using equation \eqref{pm_cumul} this can be written in terms of incomplete gamma functions 
\begin{align*}
R(y) & = \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m}  \left(1-\frac{\Gamma\left(j+1,\frac{\lambda}{\mu}
         \log\left(\frac{y}{y_{0}}\right)\right)}{j!}\right) [y_{0} \le y < y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + \left(1-\frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m} \left(1-\frac{\Gamma\left(j+1,\lambda\left(t_{1} +
         \frac{y^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}\right)\right)}{j!}\right)\right)[y < y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + [y_{1} < y]
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
R(y) & = \left(1-\frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m} \frac{\Gamma\left(j+1,\frac{\lambda}{\mu} 
         \log\left(\frac{y}{y_{0}}\right)\right)}{j!}\right) [y_{0} \le y < y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m} \frac{\Gamma\left(j+1,\lambda\left(t_{1} + 
         \frac{y^{-(r-1)}-y_{1}^{-(r-1)}}{\nu(r-1)}\right)\right)}{j!} [y < y_{1}]\\
     &   \qquad {} + [y_{1} < y]
\end{align*}
